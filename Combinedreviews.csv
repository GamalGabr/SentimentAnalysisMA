Approached management with several concerns and they were all met with “your wrong, I’m right, don’t like it then leave” primary school mentality.

"264","Sales Assistant (Current Employee) - Crosby, Merseyside - 9 January 2021","Not a bad place to work the biggest issue for me was you don't know how long each shift is going to be until you actually get on the warehouse floor some days I did a 6 hour shift then the next day might have been a 8 hour shift then it may even go as far as a 10 hour shift also they are not guaranteed hours as some times you would see its estimated to be a 6 and half hour pick and if other people don't stick to their pick rate or people go home then the 6 and half hours may become 8 hours which mean you can't plan appointments make plans to go out as you never know what time you will actually finish, also you are paid to every quarter to which means for eg if you finish at 12.05 they actually sign you out at 12.00 so you lose 5 minutes you imagine they do this to 60 people per shift and how much money they save but yet your expected to be on the warehouse floor and logged in 10 minutes early and the last thing would be you only get one break if shift lengths estimated less than 8 hours so if they estimate shift length at 7 and half hours you get one break at 25 minutes which is poor because 5 minutes of this time is classed as your walk time to and from the canteen 2 and half minutes to get their and same back so you actually only get 20 minutes break they should have atleast 3 breaks for this type of work","None","Unknown shift lengths, 1 break time","ALDI"

Your health can suffer from here, working mixed shifts each week from early starts to late's all in the same week which is not right for your health. Some people always have same shift, people are not moved around store enough, can be stuck on tills for too long, times to complete a pallet can be ridiculous. They need to keep on top of personal development or of course we will not be up to standard in a particular section if we have not been on it for so long . With that said, there are some nice staff, some really nice customers too, and there is also a app with the rota which is handy.

The management has a ""if your face fits"" culture and form cliques, you literally are just another number to most people. Most if not all staff feel the same and are either looking for another job or are old enough to be satisfied that retirement isn't too far away. The management structure is flawed and gets swapped and changed quite often as do staff positions, one minute your working in one department, and then 6 months later the store has a reshuffle and you're moved somewhere else. Again, the jobs themselves are easy to do and almost any monkey with a brain can do them, you just don't get treated right unless your in the friend group. Work here if your in between jobs or just starting out, do not work here looking for a career as the progression in this job is so few and far between they may as well tell you from the start that you will not progress.","Flexible, decent pay, friendly co worker","Long hours","MORRISONS"

Everything is fast-paced and you're given way too much responsibility, way too quickly and this can be overwhelming.

You will be thrown in the deep end from day 1, and there isn't a lot of training so be prepared to learn quickly! The variety of the job is one of the best bits, you touch pretty much every area of the business and have a great deal of responsibility. The leadership generally has strong direction, however the workplace can be very political. I would say there is a bit of a bums on seats culture although that is changing gradually. Morrisons is still quite old school in its approach to trading. The hardest part of the jobs is getting ahead with your plans and being able to stick to them and execute them. There is a constant risk of being made to change direction very late in the day. The most enjoyable part of the job...a lot of great people work at Morrisons.","None","Don’t expect to have a life outside of work","MORRISONS"

"2888","Customer Assistant (Current Employee) - Norwich - 28 January 2020","My typical day at work is to serve customers at the checkout. Pack their bags for them if they require it. Relieve staff members who are entitled a break. Put left behind items back on the shelves or any waste items go in the warehouse . If I am needed on self checkout I go there to work, where I assist customers who are scanning their items and dealing with their bar codes that will not scan or age restricted sales authorisations. I keep a look out for people who walk away without paying if I spot someone acting suspiciously  I will watch them and maybe get a little closer to them if they walk away I will call them back and inform them that their payment didn't go through or their card was declined they usually either return and make the payment or return the goods. Some times however people do get away and there is nothing you can do except report it to a manager. I also help elderly people scan their shopping for them or people who have never used a self checkout before. I also empty the bins and have a clean round . The staff are nice though not many of them left now. The management are ok. It is quite a demanding job and often fast passed especially on a Norwich city match day as they are right next door to Morrisons. The hardest part of the job is that there are 14 self scan checkouts and they expect one member off staff to run the lot. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get the odd compliment and appreciation from a customer it doesn't happen often though. And the staff are friendly and helpful we look out for one another.","Competative Pay, Relatively friendly colleagues","Long Hours, Low Pay Incentive, Lack of job security, Poor leadership","MORRISONS"

"3104","Customer Service assistant (Former Employee) - Stoke-on-Trent - 11 December 2019","Worked in several different departments over my many years at Morrisons under four different store managers. A dreadful company to work for. Your working day will be overrun with work and if you're till trained (which most staff are) you'll be pulled off your department to sit for hours helping the main tills while not making your targets on your own department. You'll be criticised for this and asked to do better. Most staff are miserable which adds to a work culture of 'every man for himself.' This company are all about making money and talk a lot about helping staff but from my own experience within this store and what others have informed me, this is all talk.  Staffing is constantly an issue. If you're from outside the UK and your first language isn't English you're going to be treated badly and ignored and bullied by the management team. Please consider working for another company.","Decent breaks","Some bad work colleagues","MORRISONS"
